üß† Homelab ‚Äî My Personal Cloud & Kubernetes Playground

Welcome to my Homelab project ‚Äî a continuously evolving learning environment where I experiment with cloud-native infrastructure, Kubernetes, and DevOps automation on real hardware at home.

This repository serves both as:

a knowledge base of everything I learn, build, and break,

and as a public portfolio showcasing my hands-on experience with modern cloud technologies.

‚öôÔ∏è Hardware Setup

My cluster is built on a small but efficient setup:

Role	Device	Specs	OS
Controller	HP ProDesk	4 vCPU / 8 GB RAM / 256 GB SSD	Ubuntu Server 24.04 LTS
Worker 1	HP EliteDesk Mini	4 vCPU / 8 GB RAM / 256 GB NVMe	Ubuntu Server 24.04 LTS
Worker 2	HP EliteDesk Mini	4 vCPU / 8 GB RAM / 256 GB NVMe	Ubuntu Server 24.04 LTS

Lightweight, power-efficient, and perfect for experimentation.
